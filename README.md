# NetTestSrv
The scriptable tcp\udp server

This is a TCP\UDP server. But with inbuilt scripts. I.e when something send at the port executes a pascal script
and you can working with this data. The scripting engine supports plugins, sample scripts are attached, as well as an example plugin.  
By default, the server deploys on port 5050, but can be changed in the settings. 
If this necessary for Linux, is tested under Mac, so I think it will be compiled under Linux without any special edits.
